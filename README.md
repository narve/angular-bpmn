# Angular BPMN Sample project

added context-pad support by timelot - rest is the same like forked.

This is a simple project demonstrating how to integrate Angular (~~5~~ ~~6~~ 7) with the 
BPMN-JS components. It is the start of a rewrite of my previous project integrating 
Angular2 with BPMN-JS: https://github.com/narve/ang2-bpmnjs.  

The previous project was created in an ancient period when Angular2 was still hot, 
and suffered from several problems, 
chief among them the complicated setup (lots of webpack configuration) and difficulty 
of upgrading components.  

This time around I wanted to use the Angular CLI and as many defaults, standards and conventions as possible. 
The main objective is to have a simple, standardized solution, making it easy to maintain and 
upgrade the code. 

NB: This project is not affiliated with / created by / endorsed by (etc) Camunda/BPMN.IO or anybody but myself. 


# Feedback

Feedback is welcome, as issues, pull requests, comments, whatever. Without feedback this project 
will be left unmaintained. 


# Documentation

The documentation is kept to a bare minimum in order to avoid out-of-date information. 
Especially Angular is a moving target.  
Consult the documentation for Typescript/Angular/AngularCLI/BPMN-JS. Remember to check that 
you are viewing the correct version!
 
To run this project with live-reload etc: 
 
    git clone git@github.com:narve/angular-bpmn.git
    cd angular-bpmn
    npm install
    npm start 
    
Then look at http://localhost:4200. 

Or else, to run using plain http-server

    npm run build
    npx run http-server dist


NB: The prod-mode is currently not working - it builds but fails at runtime. 

To run in prod-mode:

    npm run start-prod
    
or

    npm run build-prod
    npx run http-server dist

# Requirements / Tested on
 
- Linux (Mint)
- Windows (plain Powershell, not Git Bash) 
- Linux-On-Windows (WSL)

- npm v9.2.11 (probably works on other versions) 

# Features / Status

- Angular CLI based project (see `docs` and `package.json` for exact versions).
- No installation / setup required, besides `node`/`npm`

- Async loading of a sample BPMN diagram
- Properties panel
- Custom properties (extending original)
- Custom palette (extending original)

- Surprisingly little actual code (including configuration files!)
- Hopefully usable as a template / inspiration for actual production use
- Hopefully as future-proof as any front-end code can be these days


# Known bugs / limitations
